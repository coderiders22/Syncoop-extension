# ⚡ Syncoop Extension for VS Code

> 🚀 Seamlessly integrate the Syncloop UI editor into Visual Studio Code for efficient API service development.

The **Syncoop Extension** embeds the Syncloop UI editor into a webview within VS Code, enabling developers to **create, edit, and manage API services** without leaving their IDE. Built for performance, security, and extensibility, this extension leverages the VS Code Webview API, robust error handling, and configurable settings to deliver a streamlined API development experience.

## ✨ Features

- **Embedded Syncloop UI**: Interact with the Syncloop editor directly within VS Code via an embedded iframe.
- **Persistent Storage**: Save and load service data using `syncloop-service.json` in the workspace.
- **Customizable Server URL**: Configure the backend URL for development or production.
- **Security Built-In**: CSP headers and iframe sandboxing to ensure safe operation.
- **Extensible Design**: Easily adaptable for SDK-based embedding or additional UI enhancements.
- **Error Logging**: Friendly error messages and Extension Host logs for easier debugging.

---

## 🏗️ Architecture

| Component         | Description |
|-------------------|-------------|
| **VS Code Webview** | Loads the Syncloop UI editor using an `<iframe>` and `postMessage` for interaction. |
| **Syncloop Server** | Hosts the editor UI at `http://localhost:8080` (configurable). |
| **Extension Logic** | Handles lifecycle, storage, and message routing using the VS Code Extension API. |
| **Security**        | CSP and sandboxing policies ensure safe iframe embedding. |

### Key Implementation Details:

- **Communication**: Editor uses `postMessage` to send save events.
- **Persistence**: Saves API data using the FileSystem API to a JSON file.
- **Debugging**: Errors are logged to the *Extension Host Output* channel.

---

## 🛠️ Prerequisites

Ensure the following before using the extension:

- **VS Code**: v1.89.0 or higher — [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- **Node.js**: v18.x+ — [Download](https://nodejs.org/)
- **Syncloop Server**: Running at `http://localhost:8080`  
  _Contact the maintainer for server setup support._

---

## 📦 Installation

### For End Users:

1. **Download** the `.vsix` file from the [Releases](#) page.
2. **Install in VS Code**:
   - Open the Extensions sidebar (`Ctrl+Shift+X` / `Cmd+Shift+X`).
   - Click `...` > **Install from VSIX...**
   - Select `syncoop-extension-0.0.1.vsix`.

You should now see **Syncoop Extension** in your installed extensions.

---

## 🚀 Usage

### 1. Start Syncloop Server

Make sure your server is running:
```

[http://localhost:8080/index.html](http://localhost:8080/index.html)

````

### 2. Open a Workspace

Open any folder in VS Code (`File > Open Folder`) to enable saving of data.

### 3. Launch the Webview

- Open the Command Palette: `Ctrl+Shift+P` / `Cmd+Shift+P`
- Type and run: `Show Syncloop Webview`

### 4. Create and Manage Services

- Use the editor as you would on the web.
- All data is saved to `syncloop-service.json` in your project.

---

## ⚙️ Configuration

Custom settings can be applied via VS Code Settings:

| Setting | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `syncoop.serviceBaseUrl` | Base URL of your Syncloop server. Default: `http://localhost:8080` |

To configure:
1. Open Settings: `Ctrl+,` / `Cmd+,`
2. Search: `Syncoop`
3. Update the **Service Base URL** as needed.

---

## 💻 Development Setup

### 1. Clone the Repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/manavrai/Syncoop-extension.git
cd Syncoop-extension
````

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Launch in Development Mode

```bash
code .
```

Press `F5` to start the Extension Development Host and run `Show Syncloop Webview`.

---

### 🔁 Switch to SDK Embedding (Advanced)

To use the Syncloop SDK (`syncloop.min.js`) instead of the iframe:

1. Modify `extension.js` to include SDK logic.
2. Update CSP policies to allow inline/script resources.
3. Test thoroughly — this eliminates the server dependency.

---

## 📲 Packaging and Distribution

### Package

```bash
npx @vscode/vsce package
```

Generates `syncoop-extension-0.0.1.vsix`.

### Publish (Optional)

1. Create a publisher at [Visual Studio Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).
2. Publish:

```bash
npx @vscode/vsce publish
```

## 🐞 Troubleshooting

| Issue               | Fix                                                                            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| Webview not loading | Ensure server is running & URL is correct. Check Output logs (Extension Host). |
| Data not saving     | Open a workspace folder and ensure write permissions.                          |
| CORS issues         | Update server to allow CORS for VS Code domains.                               |
